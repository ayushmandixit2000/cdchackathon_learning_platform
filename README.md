# cronoslearn Documentation

cronoslearn is North Hill Institution's solution for crypto.com's the next gen hackathon. As individuals interested in both blockchain and webdevelopment, we combibned these two aspects to come up with a MVP for our idea.

## cronoslearn Webapp

The cronoslearn webapp is built using React. Simply install Node.js and node package dependencies to begin.

```bash
cd cdchackathon_learning_platform/
npm install --force
npm start
```

The webapp will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default

The live site can be found at https://cdchackathon-cronoslearn.vercel.app

On the webapp users are able to authenticate with their web3 wallets and mint NFTs, both on the cronos chain. This is done via the Moralis SDK

## NFT Minting
Developers are able to mint NFTs on the cronos chain upon finishing their projects.
